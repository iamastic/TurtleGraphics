# TurtleGraphics
Created a parser for Logo Turtle Programming. Alongside this, I created a basic replica of the Turtle Graphics using SDL2. 

## Instructions
* Type: 'make parse' for Production Output.
* Then type 'make runParse'.

* Type: 'make parse_s' for Output with Sanitize flags.
* Then type, make runParse_s.

* Type: 'make parse_v' for Output with Valgrind.
* Then type, make runParse_v.

* Type: 'make interp' for Output via SDL.
* Then type, make runInterp.

* Type: 'make extension' for Output via SDL.
* Then type, make runExtension.

## Further instructions are available in testing.txt and extension.txt.
